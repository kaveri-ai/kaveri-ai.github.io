## Introduction
IN Progress


### Our Work




#### BERT based model Approach
Recent advancements in text architectures such as Transformers and BERT have improved accuracy the
of Question-Answering, Text Classification, Sentiment Analysis and various other tasks.

We calculated BERT similarity between emails instead of TF-IDF to improve the results. 

BERT is trained on huge corpuses of text and understands the semantics better 

We have used BERT in Q&A and text classification. You can find more details [here](.)
